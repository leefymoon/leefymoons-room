                <p>hey guys, how are you all? i'm not that great :/ i'm getting burnt out from school again. it's like a never ending cycle, i get a break from school then when i get back i'm bombarded with work. as much as i like learning and seeing my friends, it's so tiring doing all the work, especially when you're a good student and everyone expects good grades out of you and you don't want to let them down. i do all this work and sometimes it feels lime there's no true reward. luckily spring break starts this weekend. love you all.</p>
