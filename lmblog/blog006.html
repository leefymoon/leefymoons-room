                <p>happy december!! i can't wait for break... well i had an awful stomach bug over thanksgiving but besides that not much has happened. today i discovered my math teacher (who i probably shared my site to.. hey mr.m!) is into web design! he even showed me some of his js code on his site which is pretty sick! i'm probably going to (try to) continue learning js, we'll see though... that's all i have to share, if i don't post again before the holidays, happy holidays!!</p>
