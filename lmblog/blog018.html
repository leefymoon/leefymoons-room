                <p>hey guys!! lately i've been on the web a lot, aned enjoying it ^^ i feel like the internet can be the best if you're in the right spaces. i've cut tiktok and instagram out of my life and it's been great! idk modern mainstream culture just doesn't interest me. i've been on tumblr and spacehey, i gotta say it's way better. i feel like i'm actually connecting with a community that i resonate with!! i also started making graphics and i enjoy it! it's an art medium (if u can call it that) that allows my full creativity, and i love it. feel free to request some graphics on tumblr @leefymoon ^^ i also went thrifting the other day with my mom and got two $80 monitors for $25 each!! they're fairly modern, acer kc2 released in 2023, 1080p, 100hz refresh rate. they lookn amazing, especially for only being 1080p! overall i've just really been enjoying being on the internet, despite all the negatives about it. i'm sure there's a possibility that i'm only enjoying it more because school is starting soon, but even then i'm still happy. that's all for now, probs next blog post will be back to school. bye!!</p>
