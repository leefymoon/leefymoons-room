                <p>hello gang. ok no. idk what to call yall but alr. so summer has begun (clearly) and its a hot one!! most days its at least 85, so i stay inside.. my friend slept over last week so that was fire, we mainly watched a lot of youtube lol no complaints tho!! i've been playing a lot of vrchat lately, and BOY what chaos that is. slurs being thrown around left and right, people asking you invasive questions, a whole ton of fun. but once you find your people, things are fun as hell! my favorite thing rn is flying jets n shit, coolest thing ever. i've also been trying to go on walks more! as much as i want to go to the gym, my dad almost always either has shit to do or in in too much pain to go. so i usually don't ask anymore unless he offers. but i totally get it, it's not easy to cram more things into an already crammed schedule. well that's where i'll leave off today, maaaaybe you'll see another blog before the school year starts, idk.. cya soon?</p>
