                <p>hi everyone, hope you're doing splendid, cuz i'm not. *loud screaming intensifies* so regents and finals are coming up, i am t-e-r-r-i-f-i-e-d!! (reference) i really have no interest in studying so idk. i know i just have to get my ass in gear and study but it's so hard to do that most days. and on top of end of the year stress, as if it couldn't get any worse, my xbox stopped working!! it quite literally won't even load the screen for me to login. how fun. /s and i opened my xbox 360 to maybe fix its overheating issue, but it still fucking overheats!! literally stayed up until 3 in the ams with my dad just for it to NOT WORK!! ugh. thanks for listening to my rant, i gotta get going before my dad goes to the gym without me, byeeee...</p>
