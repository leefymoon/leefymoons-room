                <p>ok. so everything WAS going great, i started helping with the morning announcements, i got gold honor roll on my latest report card, so on and so forth. then BOOM, i have a head cold, i have media arts awards to go to tonight, AND i can't even stay home because of state labs in biology!! so here i am, popping dayquil in the middle of math, trying not to get other people sick. i definetely feel much better than how i was feeling yesterday though, yesterday was probs the worst i've felt with a head cold. hopefully i feel ok enough to make it to the media arts awards tonight, i want to have another great memory from hs.. anywayyy i'll hopefully blog again soon, probably when i feel better, cya soon</p>
