                <p>hey! it's been a bit, let me update you on things! i got a 100 on my ancient rome quiz last week so that's a plus! i also got a 94 on my english midterm! the writing response was an 11th grade level passage! more good news is that i'm helping my middle school art teacher with his art club! luckily the hs art club and his art club are on different days, so i don't have to worry about that. it's finally starting to get warmer here, so i guess we'll see what spring brings! see you soon!!</p>
