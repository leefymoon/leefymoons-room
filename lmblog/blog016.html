                <p>hellooo.. this blog is a tad bittersweet because the realization that my freshman year is almost over is finally kicking in. while it's something that i never want to end, i know i must grow as a person. if any of my teachers happen to be reading this, thank you for making my first year of high school great. (expect visits!!) well with that out of the way, let me talk about other things. i have my science state exams today, on top of that i am writing this at 5am because i couldn't sleep any longer! hopefully it's not as confusing to me as the midterm was, but we'll see! i have my algebra exam in a week on the 18th, sooo excited.. at least with algebra though i know what i'm doing for the most past lol. in other news, i got my dad's pc! i also got his monitor, and don't worry i didn't rob him out of a computer and monitor, he got new ones.. so now i can play games and code and all of the fun things! and lastly, twenty one pilots is releasing a new song thursday, AND their new album is coming out in september!! :proud: i highly encourage you to listen to it, even if you're not huge on their music. it's pretty much a different genre each album, so maybe you'll like it! well this turned out to be a bit longer, i'll see you all again soon!</p>
