                <p>hey!! like i predicted, it's been a bit! (but then again i say that every blog :p) so i started 10th grade, not too bad? but i lack any friends at least 3 of my classes so that kinda sucks... but the new twenty one pilots album is out! i really love it, it's an on brand sound but also so different at the same time. i went to the listening party for it too! (and destroyed my knees from standing :']) i got a boxset for the album aaaand a first pressing edition cd so i'm super lucky ^^ today the new skate game comes out!! it's definitely not what anyone playing skate 3 back then would've expected, but i think it still has potential! i'm super excited for it to come out, literally gonna be the first thing i do after i do my hw hehehehe. well that's it for today, i'll post again soon... (maybe)</p>
