                            <p>oh my beloved ipods... where do i start?? my interest in ipods came from no one other than dankpods! (i know, how shocking...) BUT hear me out. i'm not like one of those retroslop elitests that only like ipod because they're "old". i like ipods because i'm a nerd :3 that and streaming music isn't really that great anymore... i love the designs of the different ipods, especially the numerous colors of the ipod nanos *_* i actually have an ipod of my own! it a purple 4th gen nano (see in picture) and i LOVE her!! i use her as a daily driver for school and basically anytime i leave the house. sure it's an 8gb model, but she still gets the job done :]</p>

                            <p>i always wanted a wii u when i was younger, but sadly to this day i still do not have one :( but thank god for emulators! my friend has gotten me into playing super mario 3d world with her by remoting into her pc and using cemu. while it's a bit of a hassle to do with her on linux, it's still quite fun getting to play games that i wanted to play when i was younger. we've also been playing a lot of mario kart 8 (which she kicks my ass in) and sometimes our friends join in! it did become unusable at one point because cemu was being all screwy on her new install of linux, so she had to reinstall linux 2 or 3 times T_T but i would say it was worth the struggle because now we can play pretty much any wii u game ^^</p>
