                        <p>hey!! like i predicted, it's been a bit! (but then again i say that every blog :p) so i started 10th grade, not too bad? but i lack any friends at least 3 of my classes so that kinda sucks... but the new twenty one pilots album is out! i really love it, it's an on brand sound but also so different at the same time. i went to the listening party for it too! (and destroyed my knees from standing :']) i got a boxset for the album aaaand a first pressing edition cd so i'm super lucky ^^ today the new skate game comes out!! it's definitely not what anyone playing skate 3 back then would've expected, but i think it still has potential! i'm super excited for it to come out, literally gonna be the first thing i do after i do my hw hehehehe. well that's it for today, i'll post again soon... (maybe)</p>

                        <p>hey guys!! lately i've been on the web a lot, aned enjoying it ^^ i feel like the internet can be the best if you're in the right spaces. i've cut tiktok and instagram out of my life and it's been great! idk modern mainstream culture just doesn't interest me. i've been on tumblr and spacehey, i gotta say it's way better. i feel like i'm actually connecting with a community that i resonate with!! i also started making graphics and i enjoy it! it's an art medium (if u can call it that) that allows my full creativity, and i love it. feel free to request some graphics on tumblr @leefymoon ^^ i also went thrifting the other day with my mom and got two $80 monitors for $25 each!! they're fairly modern, acer kc2 released in 2023, 1080p, 100hz refresh rate. they lookn amazing, especially for only being 1080p! overall i've just really been enjoying being on the internet, despite all the negatives about it. i'm sure there's a possibility that i'm only enjoying it more because school is starting soon, but even then i'm still happy. that's all for now, probs next blog post will be back to school. bye!!</p>

                        <p>hellooo.. this blog is a tad bittersweet because the realization that my freshman year is almost over is finally kicking in. while it's something that i never want to end, i know i must grow as a person. if any of my teachers happen to be reading this, thank you for making my first year of high school great. (expect visits!!) well with that out of the way, let me talk about other things. i have my science state exams today, on top of that i am writing this at 5am because i couldn't sleep any longer! hopefully it's not as confusing to me as the midterm was, but we'll see! i have my algebra exam in a week on the 18th, sooo excited.. at least with algebra though i know what i'm doing for the most past lol. in other news, i got my dad's pc! i also got his monitor, and don't worry i didn't rob him out of a computer and monitor, he got new ones.. so now i can play games and code and all of the fun things! and lastly, twenty one pilots is releasing a new song thursday, AND their new album is coming out in september!! :proud: i highly encourage you to listen to it, even if you're not huge on their music. it's pretty much a different genre each album, so maybe you'll like it! well this turned out to be a bit longer, i'll see you all again soon!</p>

(reference) i really have no interest in studying so idk. i know i just have to get my ass in gear and study but it's so hard to do that most days. and on top of end of the year stress, as if it couldn't get any worse, my xbox stopped working!! it quite literally won't even load the screen for me to login. how fun. /s and i opened my xbox 360 to maybe fix its overheating issue, but it still fucking overheats!! literally stayed up until 3 in the ams with my dad just for it to NOT WORK!! ugh. thanks for listening to my rant, i gotta get going before my dad goes to the gym without me, byeeee...</p>
