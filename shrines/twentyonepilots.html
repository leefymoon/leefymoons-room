                        <p>twenty one pilots will forever have a special place in my heart. i was introduced to them by my sister in 2016 and i've loved their music ever since. they have spread a lot of awareness about mental health and i think that's one of the maany things that drag people to them. they show so much love and support for their fans, and that makes them a great band. please if you get a chance, listen to some of their music, it might change your life for the better <3</p>
